      <p>
        My educational journey reflects a deliberate pursuit of interdisciplinary excellence. 
        Starting with a strong foundation in computer science at Chemeketa Community College, 
        where I dove into programming fundamentals and cybersecurity, I quickly realized that 
        technology alone wasn't enough to create meaningful solutions for today's complex challenges.

      <p>
        This realization led me to explore diverse areas: from digital photography and media arts, 
        which taught me the importance of user experience and visual communication, to business 
        courses that helped me understand how technology solutions fit into larger organizational 
        goals. My coursework in psychology and human relations provided invaluable insights into 
        how people interact with technology, while communication studies enhanced my ability to 
        bridge the gap between technical solutions and user needs.
      </p>

      <p>
        The culmination of this journey at Eastern Oregon University, where I earned my BS in 
        Liberal Studies with minors in Media Arts-Communication and Business, represents more 
        than just academic achievement. It demonstrates my commitment to understanding problems 
        from multiple angles and crafting solutions that consider both technical efficiency and 
        human impact.

      <p>
        Today, as I focus on AI and automation, this diverse background proves invaluable. 
        I approach technology not just as a tool, but as part of a larger ecosystem that 
        includes human needs, business requirements, and social impact. My liberal arts 
        education has equipped me with the critical thinking skills to ask not just "How?" 
        but "Why?" and "What if?" - essential questions in the rapidly evolving field of AI.
